      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        GRO is a digital platform built to solve regional Australia&apos;s childcare workforce shortage. It connects international early childhood educators with rural childcare providers via streamlined visa sponsorship workflows.
        The platform enables towns and providers to offer DAMA pathways, share onboarding support resources, and match educators to roles based on their eligibility, visa needs, and location preferences.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Workforce Shortages:</b> Many rural areas lack access to qualified childcare professionals, forcing families onto waitlists or closing centres entirely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Complex Visa Processes:</b> Regional providers struggle to navigate DAMA or skilled migration pathways to attract qualified educators internationally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Limited Visibility:</b> Prospective educators have no easy way to explore regional opportunities, assess visa eligibility, or get community insights.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Community Hub:</b> Interactive regional profiles highlighting childcare centres, schools, and lifestyle benefits for incoming workers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Visa & Sponsorship Toolkit:</b> Step-by-step guidance, eligibility tools, and DAMA pathway checklists for both providers and candidates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Smart Matching:</b> Matches candidates with centres based on visa pathway, region preference, and role fit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Council Partnership Mode:</b> Councils can coordinate campaigns, add migration incentives, and publish regional demand data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>↑150%</b> — Increase in international educator applications</li>
        <li><b>3x</b> — Faster visa preparation times</li>
        <li><b>+40</b> — Regional towns onboarded</li>
        <li><b>↓65%</b> — Reduction in childcare waitlists</li>
      </ul>
