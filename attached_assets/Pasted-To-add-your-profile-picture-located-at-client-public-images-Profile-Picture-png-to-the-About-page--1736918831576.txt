To add your profile picture located at client/public/images/Profile_Picture.png to the 'About' page, you can include an <img> element in your About component. Here’s how you might do that:

Find a suitable location in the rendering section of the About component to add the image.
Use the correct path to reference the profile picture, which will be /images/Profile_Picture.png when your app is served.
Here’s the updated code for the About component:

import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { SkillsVisualization } from "@/components/sections/SkillsVisualization";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { useState } from "react";
export function About() {
  const [isFrontendOpen, setFrontendOpen] = useState(true);
  const skills = [
    // ... (your existing skills array)
  ];
  const categoryIcons = {
    Frontend: "/icons/frontend.svg",
    Backend: "/icons/backend.svg",
    Tools: "/icons/tools.svg",
    "AI & Data Analytics": "/icons/ai.svg",
    "Customer Success": "/icons/customersuccess.svg",
  };
  const renderSkillsByCategory = (category) => {
    // ... (your existing renderSkillsByCategory function)
  };
  return (
    <motion.main
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-b from-black via-gray-900 to-black"
    >
      {/* Add Profile Picture */}
      <section className="flex justify-center pt-10">
        <img
          src="/images/Profile_Picture.png"
          alt="Profile Picture"
          className="w-32 h-32 rounded-full object-cover"
        />
      </section>
      {/* Hero Section */}
      <section className="pt-32 pb-24 px-4 relative overflow-hidden">
        <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-12">
          {/* ... (rest of your existing hero section) */}
        </div>
      </section>
      {/* ... (rest of your existing About component) */}
    </motion.main>
  );
}
Changes Made:
Added a new section to display the profile picture using an <img> tag.
Set the src attribute to refer to the path where the image is stored.
Applied some basic styling to the image to ensure it appears well-rounded and centered.
This will display your profile picture at the top of the About page when rendered.
