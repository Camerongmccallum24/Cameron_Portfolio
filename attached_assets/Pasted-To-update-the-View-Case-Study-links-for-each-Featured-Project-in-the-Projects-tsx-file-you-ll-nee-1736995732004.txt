To update the 'View Case Study' links for each Featured Project in the Projects.tsx file, you'll need to edit the projects array. Below is the updated code with the appropriate links added:

import React from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { ExternalLink, Github, Info } from "lucide-react";
import {
  Tooltip,
  TooltipContent,
  TooltipProvider,
  TooltipTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/tooltip";
import { ShareButtons } from "@/components/ui/ShareButtons";
export default function Projects() {
  // ... (rest of the component code)
  const projects = [
